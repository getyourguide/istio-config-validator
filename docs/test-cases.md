# TestCases Reference

This document describes how one can define test cases to be used by the testing framework. Refer to the [examples](https://github.com/getyourguide/istio-config-validator/tree/main/examples) to understand how to test different use cases.

## TestCases

Test cases objects are interpreted by the framework to build up the mock and run the tests agaisnt the configuration.
